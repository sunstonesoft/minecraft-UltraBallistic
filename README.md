> Requires Vault

UltraBallistic is a new Minecraft plugin that adds ballistic rockets to your server. It provides exciting new gameplay elements, allowing players to rocket from one place to another in an instant! This plugin using vault api to make manipulations with money. I'm also will make airstirkes (a lot of rockets in almost same place).



Developing this plugin is not particularly challenging but requires a good knowledge of Java programming language and understanding of how plugins work in order to make it truly amazing.
